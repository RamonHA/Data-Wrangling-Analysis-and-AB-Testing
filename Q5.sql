--Use the https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics ( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence. 

-- For the views_binary:
-- The p-value is on 0.36 meaning that the results are not statistically significant
-- The calcultaed lift is 1.9%
-- And the range of improvement is of -2.1% to 5.9%
-- Being the p-value above a 10% level of significance, 
-- shows a no significance difference in the test between the control and test group.

-- For the order binary:
-- The p-value is of 0.74, with and improvement range of -15% to 11%.
-- This one too, its p-value is above a 10% significance level
-- so no significance difference is found between the control and test group.
